        - Use a **clear and descriptive title**, e.g., `[Feature]: Add animation support for menu opening`.
        - Focus on the **problem**, not just the solution ‚Äî this helps us think of other potential improvements.
        - Include **code samples**, **mockups**, or **GIFs** if possible.
        - Check [existing issues](https://github.com/salah-rashad/flutter_context_menu/issues) to avoid duplicates.
